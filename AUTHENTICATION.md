# **privatize data**

By default, `rating-operator` data are available to everyone having access to the `rating-api`.
It has been designed to be used as a cluster-wide rating solution, and thus, does not privatize the data natively.
For use-cases corresponding to internal services administration, the default settings should be used, as they provide a complete access to data via endpoints.

However, in a context where one might want to provide its user private namespaces and data ownership, we provide a multi-tenancy system.
You can register you users with the `/sign_up` endpoint (admin key required), which will add it to our database, and provide namespaces to deploy its applications.
Then, user logs via `/login` and start querying.
Only the data generated by the namespaces owned by this user will be available.

If you want to go back to the public data, use `/logout` to close the session.

The underlying system uses namespaces labels to function, editing those manually is not recommended.

All the multi-tenancy enpoints are described ([here](https://git.rnd.alterway.fr/overboard/5gbiller/rating-api/-/blob/master/README.md)).
