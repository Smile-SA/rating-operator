# RATING-OPERATOR BASE CONFIGURATION

# This file holds the default configuration used by Helm to build the rating-operator manifests.
# It is not directly targeted at the end-user, as it require rebuilding of the operator images to take effect.
# To override values present here, modify the deploy/crds/charts.helm.k8s.io_v1alpha1_rating_cr.yaml file and run the installation scripts.

## The security part of the configuration is related to your cluster authentication method (cert files, token, non local users management)
security:
  # The "auth" flag enables TLS/HTTPS verification in the component
  # Enable it if your cluster uses HTTPS
  auth: "false"

  # The "adminToken" string configure the application security key
  # It is used for administrator requests to the rating-operator-api and as a secret key for session encoding
  token:
    admin: thisisadmintoken

  # The "adminAccount" variable defines the which tenant is considered admin.
  # Usually, the default "admin" is enough. Some external applications already using the "admin" name could motivate to change this parameter.
  # Don't forget to edit the Grafana deployment accordingly, to syncronise both adminAccount values.
  adminAccount: admin
  # Keycloak can be used as an authentication method through the operator.
  # Setting enabled to "false" will configure the rating-operator to use its own local user management
  keycloak:
    enabled: "false"

    ## Below the configuration for the Keycloak server
    # serverUrl: "my_url_keycloak"
    # clientID: rating-operator
    # realmName: "my_realm"
    # clientSecretKey: "bakshdhb-dkjashbdjh-dkjahdfskl"
